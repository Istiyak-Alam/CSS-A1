        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        
        <br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
        <br>
        
        <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Css is not necessary</span>
            <span style="background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>
            It can be layout of multiple web pages all at once.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="line">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>

    </ol>
    
    <h3 class="space">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    
    <ul type="disc" id="style">
        <li>Inline-by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal-by using a style element in the head sectiom</li>
        <li>External-by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in external files.However.
            <span style="background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">In this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>
                because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference in that CSS class applied a style to ,multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special is that you can use a special URl to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In CSS selection are used to target a specific element or range of elements ona web page.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
